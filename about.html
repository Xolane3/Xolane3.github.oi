        <h2>My History</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Xolane Shabalala. I hail from the serene town of Dannhauser
          in KwaZulu-Natal, where I began my educational journey at Mana High
          School. My interest in accounting led me to study the subject from
          2012 to 2018, building a solid academic foundation. In 2019, I
          enrolled at Tshwane University of Technology, pursuing a National
          Diploma in Information Technology: Multimedia. This period was
          transformative, allowing me to blend technology with creativity
          through web design, graphic design, and video production. I completed
          my theoretical studies in 2023. To stay updated with technological
          advancements, I completed an 8-week online course titled "Artificial
          Intelligence Career Essentials" in 2024. Currently, I am seeking Work
          Integrated Learning (WIL) opportunities to gain practical experience
          and apply my knowledge in real-world settings. Driven by curiosity and
          a commitment to continuous learning, I am eager to contribute my
          diverse skill set to innovative projects. I value community,
          creativity, and collaboration and look forward to connecting with
          like-minded individuals and organizations to create impactful
          solutions.
